# Estimote Proximity SDK for Android #

Oh, I see you managed to find this super secret sneak-peak of Estimote's newest Proximity SDK for Android!
Well, hold your horses - ain't all the stuff finished. This place still lacks an amazing docs or magical app example. But if you are brave enough, you may enter the mysterious world of super-duper fresh SDK now - use the below spell recipe to tame the magical beast known as "Proximity-SDKosaurus":

```Gradle
compile 'com.estimote:proximity-sdk:0.1.0-alpha.2'
```

Psst... the magical word is `ProximityObserver`. I heard you could get it in the mysterious place known as `ProximityObserverFactory`. Perhaps you might find it also useful to read the ancient tome commonly known as blogpost. It may appear soon somwhere over [here](http://blog.estimote.com/). 

Don't say I didn't warn you, brave adventurer!
